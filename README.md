> Coding: Existing methods of different classes and diff ways to create some functionalities for which methods are not there.

### Prime Number
* nth element in Fibonacci series
* Find duplicate element in array
* Find n highest occurrence element in array  2,3,4,1,3,5,6,2,4,4,4,2  4-4,2-3   n=2
* Check if String is palindrome
* Make a string palindrome with minimum change
* <7>	Write a program to find the highest product of 3 element from the array ex: {3,5,2,1,0} = 30								
* <8>	Find all substring of size k and return in an List/Array for a given string; ex: "abcdbb", k=3, abc,dbb, bcd, .... , abcd...,abcdb.... and so on								
* <9>	Create a Person Class, create Address class, add a list of addressIds in Person class, and addressId, City, Flat, State, etc, create list objects of Person and populate all the values, find all city list from those people list pelong to using Funcational programing								
* <10>	Write program to proof the best usage of different collection like, HashMap Vs TreeMAp Vs LinkedHAshMap Vs ConcurrentMAp, when to use which Map, write a program to proof								
* <11>	Write program to proof the best usage of different collection like, Array vs ArrayList Vs LinkedList,  when to use which List or Array, write a program to proof								
* <12>	Executor Framework and Completable future demo for understading it requirement
